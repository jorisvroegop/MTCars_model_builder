<q> This MTCars Model Builder allows you to see various relationships with MPG.</q>

---
  
## Data

We use the following variables from the `mtcars` dataset:

```{r, echo = T}
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars[,c("mpg", "wt", "hp", "disp", "qsec")])
```

---

## Goal

The Shiny app let's use see the relationship between a chosen variable and `mpg` (miles per gallon). For example horsepower `hp` vs `mpg`:

```{r fig1, echo = T,  fig.align = "center", fig.asp = .75}
plot(mtcars[,c("hp", "mpg")], pch = 16)
abline(lm(mtcars[,"mpg"] ~ mtcars[,"hp"]), col="blue", lwd=2)
```
